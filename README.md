## TL;DR

-   RADIUS server for small-scale wireless networks
-   Based on [FreeRADIUS](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server)
-   Has a web dashboard for configs and PKI
-   Supports Aruba/Cisco MPSK and EAP-TLS authentication methods
-   ~~Supports for EAP-GTC and EAP-MSCHAPv2~~ in the future

## Getting Started

### Prepare

-   Clone this repository (recommended), or download the `docker-compose.yml` and create `data` directory
-   (Optional) Modify `docker-compose.yml` to use `master` branch instead of `latest` tag
-   Run `docker compose up -d` (Docker and Docker Compose plugin required)

### Configure

-   Open `http://localhost:3000` on your browser

    -   Configure your NAS clients (e.g. Aruba Mobility Controllers or Aruba Instant APs)
    -   (Optional) Configure MPSKs for WPA-Personal SSID/devices
    -   (Optional) Initialize PKI and generate certificates for EAP-TLS (WPA-Enterprise)
    -   (Optional) Download client certificates from PKI dashboard to your devices

-   Restart by using the reload button on the top-right corner, to apply changes of your NAS clients/~~MPSKs~~/PKI
